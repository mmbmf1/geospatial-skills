# ST_Distance (Numeric Distance)

Use this skill when you need the **numeric distance value** between geometries (for reporting, ranking display, metadata).

If you need a boolean “within X distance” filter, prefer `ST_DWithin` (faster). A common pattern is:

- use `ST_DWithin` to filter candidates
- use `ST_Distance` to compute the returned distance value

## Core rules

- Units depend on type:
  - `geometry` → SRID units (degrees/meters/feet depending on SRID)
  - `geography` → **meters**
- Geometries must be in the **same SRID** for geometry math
- Do not compute meaningful distances in EPSG:4326 geometry (degrees) unless you intend degrees

## Canonical patterns

## Distance in meters (recommended): geography

Works well when data is stored in EPSG:4326 and you want meters.

    SELECT
      ST_Distance(a.geom::geography, b.geom::geography) AS distance_m
    FROM a
    JOIN b ON ...;

## Distance in projected SRID units: geometry

Use a projected/client SRID where units are meaningful (feet/meters).

    SELECT
      ST_Distance(
        ST_Transform(a.geom, client_srid),
        ST_Transform(b.geom, client_srid)
      ) AS distance_units
    FROM a
    JOIN b ON ...;

## Fast filter + distance output (recommended pattern)

Filter candidates with `ST_DWithin`, then compute distance.

    WITH p AS (
      SELECT ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint($1, $2), 4326) AS geom
    )
    SELECT
      f.*,
      ST_Distance(f.geom::geography, p.geom::geography) AS distance_m
    FROM features f, p
    WHERE ST_DWithin(f.geom::geography, p.geom::geography, 5000)  -- 5km
    ORDER BY f.geom <-> p.geom
    LIMIT 50;

This is a common “map / nearby” endpoint pattern:

- `ST_DWithin` constrains work
- `<->` ranks quickly
- `ST_Distance` provides the numeric value

## Common mistakes

- Using `ST_Distance(geom, geom)` on EPSG:4326 geometry and assuming meters
- Using `ST_Distance(...) < x` in WHERE instead of `ST_DWithin(...)`
- Mixing SRIDs without transforming
- Computing distances on huge tables without bounding the search

## Summary

- Use `geography` for meters
- Use projected SRIDs for planar geometry distances
- Use `ST_DWithin` for filtering, `ST_Distance` for reporting
