# ST_DWithin (Distance / Proximity Queries)

Use this skill when you need to find features **within a given distance** of another geometry:

- “points within X meters of a line”
- proximity searches around a point
- replacing expensive buffer + intersects patterns

## Core rules

- `ST_DWithin` is **faster** than `ST_Distance < x`
- Units depend on input type:
  - `geometry` → SRID units
  - `geography` → meters
- Geometries must be in the **same SRID**
- Prefer `ST_DWithin` over buffering when you only need a boolean test

## Canonical patterns

## Geometry (projected CRS, SRID units)

Use when your data is stored in a projected SRID (feet/meters).

    SELECT *
    FROM points p
    JOIN lines l
      ON ST_DWithin(p.geom, l.geom, 5);

Distance `5` is in the SRID’s units.

## Geography (meters, easiest default)

Use when geometry is stored in EPSG:4326 and you want meters.

    SELECT *
    FROM points p
    JOIN lines l
      ON ST_DWithin(
        p.geom::geography,
        l.geom::geography,
        5
      );

Distance `5` is meters.

## Transform once (projected math, better for large jobs)

When using a client/project SRID:

    SELECT *
    FROM points p
    JOIN lines l
      ON ST_DWithin(
        ST_Transform(p.geom, client_srid),
        ST_Transform(l.geom, client_srid),
        5
      );

Transforming both sides is acceptable here because `ST_DWithin` can still use indexes in many cases, but prefer transforming the smaller side if possible.

## Point near line (common validation pattern)

    SELECT p.*
    FROM points p
    JOIN lines l
      ON ST_DWithin(
        p.geom::geography,
        l.geom::geography,
        5
      );

Use this instead of buffering lines unless you need the actual corridor geometry.

## Index requirements

Ensure GiST indexes exist:

    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS points_geom_gix ON points USING gist (geom);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS lines_geom_gix ON lines USING gist (geom);

`ST_DWithin` can leverage spatial indexes when used correctly.

## Common mistakes

- Using `ST_Distance(...) < x` instead of `ST_DWithin`
- Forgetting geometry vs geography unit differences
- Mixing SRIDs without transforming
- Buffering geometries just to test proximity

## Summary

- Prefer `ST_DWithin` for distance tests
- Use `geography` for meters when in 4326
- Use projected SRIDs for heavy planar work
- Index geometry columns
